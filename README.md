# CampaignViewer
Programming challenge for MediaMath. I created a Campaign Viewer using their sample API. To do this I used React/Redux.

Technologies used: React, Redux, Redux-thunk, Modular SCSS, Webpack, Axios, React-Datetime

Note: If you run into problems with the GitHub pages delpoyment, it is probably due to your firewall blocking the API call due to an invaild certificate. In that case just download the project and run it.

Usefull commands:

To install depenencies: "npm/yarn install"

To run dev server: "npm/yarn start" or "npm/yarn run dev"
