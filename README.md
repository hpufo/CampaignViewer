# CampaignViewer
Deployed on GH Pages: https://hpufo.github.io/CampaignViewer

Programming challenge for MediaMath. I created a Campaign Viewer using their sample API. To do this I used React/Redux.

Technologies used: React, Redux, Redux-thunk, Modular SCSS, Webpack, Axios, React-Datetime

Note: If my deployment is not doing the API call, it is probably due to your firewall blocking the https request/response from the API. In that case either allow it or download the project and change https to http in src/js/config.js

Usefull commands:

To install depenencies: "npm/yarn install"

To run dev server: "npm/yarn start" or "npm/yarn run dev"
