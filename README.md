# CampaignViewer
Programming challenge for MediaMath. I created a Campaign Viewer using their sample API. To do this I used React/Redux.

Technologies used: React, Redux, Redux-thunk, Modular SCSS, Webpack, Axios, React-Datetime

Note: GHPages is using my API. If you run into any API problems when you run this project locally change the flag to false to use my API in src/js/config.js

Usefull commands:

To install depenencies: "npm/yarn install"

To run dev server: "npm/yarn start" or "npm/yarn run dev"
